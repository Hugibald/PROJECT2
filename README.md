The second Project was the FullStack Project and the final Task for the Bootcamp-Course.
We were put into groups of 4-5 people and had to choose a Project-leader, if we wanted to use Vanilla PHP or Symfony and what Topic we wanted to make our Project about.
The possibilities were: A) Q&A Tool, B) Meal Planner, C) E-commerce Site, D) Pet Adoption Platform, or E) Morning Routine Manager App
We quickly decided, since most of us had had issues with Symfony working correctly on our settings, that we would work with Vanilla PHP and that we would make an E-commerce Site, since we thought that we would benefit from the experience the most.
Also our Project-Leader was choosen quickly.
Unluckily the time the project happened to fall in was a time everyone got sick, so we couldn't meet on site too often.
So we held regular meetings via Microsoft Teams and communicated constantly via our Slack-Channel.
Also we used a Miro-Board to plan and keep track of our tasks.
After we agreed on a product we wanted to focus on, since we didn't have a lot of time for the project, we started to think through the logic of our database.
The final version of the concept was done by me and I created the database as well.

What was asked of us in this project:
There were 3 different types of users: Guests (not logged in), Users (registered and logged in) and Admins (registered and logged and set admin by another admin).
Guests were to see the Register-Page, the login page and the home-page as well the sites: about us, impressum, Terms & Conditions as well as the Privacy Policy and the Contact-Information in the footer (which was set as optional).
Once registered and logged in the user would have access to the index-page, the products-site with individual detail-pages, the update-page for their own profile as well as their shopping-cart.
They should be able to update and delete their own account add items to their cart, rate the products they have bought before, ask questions to products and edit and check out their cart as well as search for products.
Also they should be able to save their data for faster checkout.
Admins, once logged in, would be able to Create, Read, Update and Delete all the Products, all the registered useres (and admins) and the suppliers.
They should be able to manage Orders, answer or delete Questions, check or delete Reviews, block or bann Users, manipulate the index-page and set discounts.
They also should see sales-statistics and asign Products to categories.
Additionally there were some nice-to-haves, which we didn't have the time to include all but some:
An implemented Google-Maps API, Payment Integrations (PayPal, ...), Profile-Pictures for users, temporary user-ban with expiration-date (we didn't do that).

We only got feedback for projects, no points, after the presentation and ours was the only project presented which had all the requirements fullfilled.

My parts in the Project were the creation and update of the Database, the checking of Errors reported to me by other team-members, I held the overview of what was already done and what we still ahd to do,
I also constantly checked the page for functionality and gave feedback to the others what they had to change or pay attention to.
Appart from the parts of the project that were my responsibility to code, I also checked the project through completely one more time before presentation, made sure all the input-forms were similar in looks and setup and that everything worked like it should.

To run this project, don't forget to import the database into your mysql and adjust the db_connect file to your settings.
